# RecyQ - E-Waste Locator

**RecyQ** is an innovative online platform designed to revolutionize e-waste management. By connecting e-waste producers with potential recyclers, RecyQ facilitates the buying and selling of reusable e-waste components, ensuring proper utilization and promoting environmental sustainability.

### Key Features
- **User-Friendly Platform**: Simplifies e-waste management for users.
- **Marketplace for E-Waste**: Allows users to list available e-waste items and enables others to purchase them for reuse.
- **Environmental Focus**: Emphasizes sustainable practices and fosters a circular economy by bridging the gap between e-waste producers and recyclers.

### Market Potential
RecyQ targets the significant e-waste market in India, which amounts to nearly 2 million tonnes annually, with only 12% currently being formally recycled. As the third-largest producer of e-waste globally, India presents a substantial opportunity for RecyQ to address recycling gaps and promote environmental awareness.

### Business Model
RecyQ operates on a commission-based model, earning revenue through transaction fees, premium subscriptions, strategic partnerships with recycling facilities and logistics providers, targeted advertising, and diversification into related verticals like refurbished electronics.
